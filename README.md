# Gadget-2 portlet README

This is the README for the [GADGET2!](http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/) HPC application.  The portlet will be deployed on science gateways, for example the Africa-Grid Science Gateway : https://sgw.africa-grid.org. why not head over there right now and see how the whole thing works - submit a few "hello-world" jobs after signing up... The SAGrid and related science gateways support identity federation, so if you want to use them, you'll need to have an account on an identity provider in an existing federation. If this is Greek to you, you can create an account on a catch-all IdP in South Africa - https://idp.sagrid.ac.za
Contact us if you're in a different country, or if you want an IdP at your institute in the federation.

# Help us test this !
If you're an astrophysicist, and you're interested in using the portlet, we're interested in your feedback to help develop the user interface. GADGET is a serious research application and we want to make running it as smooth and easy as possible. Let us know your preferred workflow, data input and output expectations, etc etc. Just open a ticket and label it "requested". We'll get back to you...
